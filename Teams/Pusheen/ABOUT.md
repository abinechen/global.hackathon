## Theme we choose
- We choose the third theme "No one reads the fine print (ie TOS, EULA, legal documents) anymore yet every site has them. Devise a creative/interactive solution".
- The README.md in our directory is defining the rule of document.
- The flow of our idea: Reading document -> answering rule game mostly correct -> if fail, return as disagree.
- Since the purpose is to make people read the document, the games will set to make them read it instead of guessing answers. The rule quiz is a multiple choice question, user needs to read it to choose answer. The rule puzzle is asking user to determine the proper catergory for the rule.
- Our project url is _____. You can try our idea on page _____. There will be a sample document on it.
